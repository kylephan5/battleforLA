2d arcade basketball game where the user controls the clippers, and the enemy is the lakers!

Controls:
Left-Click - shoot down enemy
Right-Click - shoot shots into orange hoop
WASD movements

Rules:
First Aid Kit gives +5HP
Bullet increases bullet shooting speed

You are trying to dodge the Lakers, shoot them down, while also shooting shots into the basket.
Basket will alternate sides after every make.
You have 300s to make 50 points. Shoot from behind the 3pt line for 3 pts, and inside for 2pts.

I followed a tutorial to make this game, and added my own unique basketball twist/other entities to really spice up the project and personalize it.
It was a great way for me to go more in depth with how JavaScript can handle game-like movements!
